# Setup

We recommend developing KLLVM in a modern IDE like IntelliJ which supports syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Kotlin.

IntelliJ has a community version available which has those features. Download here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download

## Getting Started

- Clone the Repository using Git
- Open it with IntelliJ
- Open project as Gradle project
    - Documentation for working with Gradle in IntelliJ found [here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-gradle-projects.html)
- Run the Test gradle task to verify everything is working
    - Documentation for running gradle tasks found [here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-gradle-tasks.html)
    - You may also run `./gradlew test` in your command line from the project root directory.
